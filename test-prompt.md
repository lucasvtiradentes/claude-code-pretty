You are being tested to exercise all Claude Code internal tools. Do each step below in order:

1. Use Glob to list all files matching `*.sh` in the current directory
2. Use Read to read the file `show-colors.sh`
3. Use Write to create a file called `tmp-test-output.txt` with the content "hello from claude test"
4. Use Edit to change "hello from claude test" to "hello from claude test - updated" in `tmp-test-output.txt`
5. Use Grep to search for the word "color" in all `.sh` files
6. Use Bash to run `echo "bash tool works" && date`
7. Use Task to launch a subagent that answers: "What is 2+2? Reply with just the number."
8. Use TodoWrite to create a todo list with 3 items: "step one" (completed), "step two" (in_progress), "step three" (pending)
9. Print a final summary saying "All tools tested successfully"
